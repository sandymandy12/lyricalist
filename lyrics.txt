~~~~~~~~ crime ~~~~~~~

Verse 1
Crime in the city
Is a petty crime
It seems like such a crime to deny
On the weekends if you have some dough

Pre-Chorus
Through crime and earthquake
They suppose good is their crime

Chorus
The world of light is deep and free
But still the mind is a wretched thing
A crime of emotions set free
In America too much crime and too much crime

Verse 2
Hate for hate and yours is lost
A perfect crime in every disguise
Put him pains on a blanket anyway
No matter what the charge or the crime

Pre-Chorus
On the phone to bed
We were partners in crime from the start

Chorus
The world of light is deep and free
But still the mind is a wretched thing
A crime of emotions set free
In America too much crime and too much crime

Bridge
Feels like a crime
To just fall to this

Chorus
The world of light is deep and free
But still the mind is a wretched thing
A crime of emotions set free
In America too much crime and too much crime

Say Peaches washed her life away
